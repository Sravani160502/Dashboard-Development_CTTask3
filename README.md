Task Description : 
For the internship task3 at CODTECH, I developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI based on a dataset consisting of 40 records related to individual investment behaviors. The primary objective of this project was to visualize and analyze how different people make investment decisions, understand the types of investments they prefer, their motivations, and what they expect in return from their investments. The dataset included essential attributes such as investment type, purpose of investment, expected outcomes, and other behavioral patterns. Through careful analysis and thoughtful design, I transformed this dataset into a dynamic dashboard that provides meaningful and actionable insights. The dashboard includes several visual elements like bar charts, pie charts, and donut charts that make it easy to interpret complex data at a glance. These visuals showcase comparisons between different investment options, highlight the main purposes behind customer investments, and reveal the most common expectations such as wealth creation, tax benefits, or securing the future. The inclusion of interactive filters allows users to explore specific subsets of data—for example, filtering based on investment types or expected returns—making the dashboard more versatile and user-friendly. Additionally, tooltips and data labels were added to enhance clarity, enabling users to understand the values represented without overwhelming the visual layout. This design approach ensures that both financial analysts and general users can extract relevant information efficiently. One of the key insights observed from the dashboard was the pattern of customers favoring certain investment types over others, particularly those offering long-term benefits or perceived stability. The analysis also highlighted that while wealth generation remained the most common investment expectation, a significant number of customers invested with the goal of achieving tax savings or planning for future security. Such insights can guide financial institutions in tailoring their services and advisory strategies to meet client needs more effectively. Another important observation was the clear alignment between investment purposes and the risk levels individuals were willing to accept. Users aiming for future security tended to invest in safer instruments, while those aiming for wealth generation showed a greater inclination towards high-risk, high-reward options. The dashboard serves not only as a reporting tool but also as a strategic asset for identifying investment trends, helping stakeholders make informed decisions. The use of Power BI enabled seamless integration of data modeling, interactive visuals, and real-time filtering capabilities, which brought clarity and depth to the investment data. Every visual on the dashboard was designed to communicate a specific insight while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive layout. By completing this project, I demonstrated my ability to work with analytical tools, understand user needs, and create impactful data visualizations that align with business goals. The end result is a functional and engaging dashboard that translates raw investment data into actionable insights, aiding in better understanding of customer behavior and supporting data-driven decision-making. This project reflects my skills in data analysis, visualization, and the practical application of business intelligence tools, contributing effectively to the goals set by CODTECH for this internship task.
